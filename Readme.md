## üöÄ Why I Built This

- The main reason: **It‚Äôs a school project** where I was tasked with creating a full website.
- To combine my passion for **fashion** and **web development**.
- To practice real-world skills in **HTML, CSS**, and **basic JavaScript functionality**.
- To create something I can be proud of and share with others.
- To challenge myself with a complete, multi-page site that goes beyond simple tutorials.
